Developments on the framework will be prioritized, though updates to documentation may happen occasionally.</p> <p>Welcome to the documentation of GoSonic2D Ultimate, a Sonic the Hedgehog framework developed in the Godot Engine that aims to recreate the original Genesis-era mechanics, systems, and physics.</p> <p>Please be warned that this documentation assumes that you already know the basics of working with the Godot Engine. If you do not, please consider to learn the basics of the engine before attempting to work with this framework, as while the documentation may explain certain Godot features briefly, it will explain them as if you are already familiar with them. Of course, that is all to your discretion.</p>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>You should first check out how to create a Zone!

(You don't necessarily have to, but it's great for organizing your scenes.)</p> <p>Then, we would need to attach a script onto it. To stay organized, you can save your zone's code into <code>res://scripts/zone/zones/</code>. (You can name it however you'd like, but again, for organization's sake, the zone's name is preferred.)</p> <p>What we need to do now is inherit the <code>Zone</code> class. This will give our <code>Node2D</code> all of the variables, functions, and all that magic needed for our level to properly function:</p> <pre><code>extends Zone\n\n# Get rid of the initial \"extends Node2D\" Godot may give you.\n</code></pre> <p>And with that, you're done.</p> <p>Well, with the initial setup, anyway.</p> <p>Now, it may be a good time to look at what actually happened to our <code>Node2D</code>, specifically, the newly added properties it gained.</p>"},{"location":"guides/creating-a-zone/#zone-properties","title":"Zone Properties","text":"<p>Just taking a glance at the many properties this thing has to offer, you may notice most properties have straightforward names, describing what function they serve.</p> <p></p> <p>To gain a better understanding of what these variables actually do, we can take a look at each of them in their respective sections:</p>"},{"location":"guides/creating-a-zone/#zone-info","title":"Zone Info","text":"Property Type Description <code>zone_name</code> String This is the display name that will be shown in the title card (e.g., \"Green Hill\"). You do not need to add \"Zone,\" as it will do that for you automatically. <code>amount_of_acts</code> int This variable determines how many acts this zone will have. For example, most of the 2D Sonic games have two acts, so for that, you would set it to <code>2</code>. <code>next_scene</code> String Here, you put in the path to the next scene that proceeds this zone. This will be the scene that will be loaded after the player finishes the zone. As a default, it is set to <code>res://scenes/title.tscn</code>. <code>scripted_intro</code> bool This turns on the scripted intro feature of a <code>Zone</code>. Essentially, instead of proceeding with the normal zone intro, it skips it, and runs the function <code>custom_intro()</code> instead. (This is explained in better detail in the Cutscenes section.)"},{"location":"guides/creating-a-zone/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"Property Type Description <code>player_resource</code> Resource In here, you would typically insert <code>sonic.tscn</code>, or whatever player object you want the <code>Zone</code> to load."},{"location":"guides/creating-a-zone/#audio","title":"Audio","text":"Property Type Description <code>zone_music</code> AudioStream This determines what <code>AudioStream</code> is requested to <code>MusicManager</code> when the function <code>_zone_music()</code> is called. <code>victory_music</code> AudioStream This determines what music is played before the score tally upon finishing an act through a sign post."},{"location":"guides/creating-a-zone/#level-settings","title":"Level Settings","text":"Property Type Description <code>starting_player_state</code> String This dropdown menu allows you to pick and choose which state the player starts in.

We forgot to create an actual surface for the player to stand on. Unless, of course, you want to make something like Sonic Falls into a Bottomless Pit Forever: The Game.</p> <p>This is the part of the process where prior Godot experience will benefit you heavily (and is likely needed).</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Making a level using built-in Godot tools like <code>TileMapLayers</code> is not exclusive to the framework, therefore, it will not be covered in this guide. You will need to learn all of that on your own if you aren't already familiar with those concepts.  (Things that are framework-specific like creating loops for the player to run through will be covered later.) Direct link to the Godot Engine documentation.</p> <p>But I'll be nice and teach you how to create a temporary surface for our player to stand on anyway. The level designing will be all up to you.</p> <p>All you really need is a <code>StaticBody2D</code>, along with a <code>CollisionShape2D</code> inside of it:</p> <p></p> <p>Then afterwards, you can set its shape into a <code>RectangleShape2D</code>:</p> <p></p> <p>Resize it to how you see fit, perhaps something like this:</p> <p>(Don't forget toput your <code>StartPointAct1</code> on top of your surface!)</p> <p></p> <p>Now, when you start up the scene, Sonic should look as if he's floating on thin air.</p> <p></p> <p>Congratulations! You've pretty much set up the bare basics of a <code>Zone</code>!</p> <p>Though... it's a bit awkward lacking any tunes. You can fix that by dragging and dropping either an <code>.ogg</code>, <code>.wav</code>, or <code>.mp3</code> file into the <code>zone_music</code> property.</p> <p>If you don't have your own, you can use one of the framework's placeholder music (chiptune renditions of some Touhou music) located at <code>res://audios/music/</code>. For organization, you can put your own music files into there as well.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"guides/creating-a-zone/#where-to-next","title":"Where to next?","text":"<p>Next, you should check out the basics of placing objects in your level!
