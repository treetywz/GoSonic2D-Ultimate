# GoSonic2D Ultimate


!!! warning

	This documentation is being constantly updated and changed alongside the repository, as the framework is currently under
	heavy, early development. Things may change constantly, and nothing is entirely stable.
	
	Additionally, the documentation is also unfinished. Developments on the framework will be prioritized,
	though updates to documentation may happen occasionally.

Welcome to the documentation of [GoSonic2D Ultimate](https://github.com/treetywz/GoSonic2D-Ultimate), a Sonic the Hedgehog framework developed in the Godot Engine that aims to recreate the original Genesis-era mechanics, systems, and physics.

Please be warned that this documentation assumes that you already know the basics of working with the Godot Engine.
If you do not, please consider to learn the basics of the engine before attempting to work with this framework, as while
the documentation may explain certain Godot features briefly, it will explain them as if you are already familiar with them.
Of course, that is all to your discretion.

## Getting Started

You should first check out [how to create a Zone!](guides/creating-a-zone.md)
Zones are integral to GoSonic2DU, so it is highly encouraged to learn the basics of how to create one.
