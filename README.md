# GoSonic2D Ultimate
GoSonic2D Ultimate *(or GoSonic2DU for short)* is a Sonic the Hedgehog framework developed in the ![Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) that aims to recreate the original Genesis-era mechanics, systems, and physics.

Development is all done in Godot 4.6.

It is the official successor to my previous framework, ![GoSonic2D+](https://github.com/treetywz/GoSonic2D-Plus), a fork of ![GoSonic2D](https://github.com/marmitoTH/GoSonic2D) originally developed in Godot 3.
